- User authentication with Firebase
- Responsive UI built with Angular
- Firebase backend for storing messages and user data
- Friend request sent and accept/reject

## Prerequisites

To get started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js** (version >= 14.x)
- **Angular CLI** (version 19.1.5 or later)
- **Firebase Account** for setting up Firebase services

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manjur-97/angular-chat-app.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash

npm install
```

### 3. Configure Firebase

To connect the app with Firebase, create a Firebase project and get your configuration details. Then, update the Firebase configuration in the `src/environments/environment.ts` file:

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  firebaseConfig: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
    messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id",
    measurementId: "your-measurement-id"
  }
};
```

### 4. Start the Development Server

Run the development server with the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, navigate to [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/) in your browser to see the app in action. The app will automatically reload if you modify any of the source files.

- **Angular CLI** (version 19.1.5 or later)
- **Firebase Account** for setting up Firebase services

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the application locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies:

bash

npm install
3. Configure Firebase
To connect the app with Firebase, create a Firebase project and get your configuration details. Then, update the Firebase configuration in the src/environments/environment.ts file:

typescript
Copy
Edit
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  firebaseConfig: {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-auth-domain",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-storage-bucket",
    messagingSenderId: "your-messaging-sender-id",
    appId: "your-app-id",
    measurementId: "your-measurement-id"
  }
};
4. Start the Development Server
Run the development server with the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
ng serve
Once the server is running, navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your browser to see the app in action. The app will automatically reload if you modify any of the source files.

### Corrections made:
1. Fixed the `git clone` URL and placed it in the correct Markdown format.
2. Corrected the closing of code blocks for the `Install Dependencies` and `Configure Firebase` sections.
3. Ensured consistent formatting for code blocks and command sections.

This should work perfectly now! Let me know if you need further assistance.
